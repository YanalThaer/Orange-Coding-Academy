    <h1>LINER EQUATION</h1>
    <p>An equation that has maximum degree one is known as liner equation. this graph of it is a straight line.</p>
    <p>For example</p>
    <li>y = 8<sub>x</sub> - 2</li>
    <li>ax<sub>1</sub> = bx<sub>2</sub> - cx<sub>3</sub> = 9</li>
    <p>are some of the examples of a liner equation in two and three variables</p>
    <p>Slop of intersection of two liner equation <br>
       y<sub>1</sub> = mx<sub>1</sub> + a and <br>
       y<sub>2</sub> = mx<sub>2</sub> + b <br>
       for the points P(x<sub>1</sub> , y<sub>1</sub>) and Q(<sub>2</sub> , y<sub>2</sub>) is: <br>
       <b>m = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>)/(x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)</b>
    </p>
